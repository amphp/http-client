 * Before executing or delegating the request, any client implementation must call {@see EventListener::startRequest()}
 * on all event listeners registered on the given request in the order defined by {@see Request::getEventListeners()}.
 * Before calling the next listener, the promise returned from the previous one must resolve successfully.
