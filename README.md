This package provides an asynchronous HTTP client for PHP based on [Amp](https://github.com/amphp/amp). Its API simplifies standards-compliant HTTP resource traversal and RESTful web service consumption without obscuring the underlying protocol. The library manually implements HTTP over TCP sockets; as such it has no dependency on `ext/curl`.

## Features

 - Requests asynchronously for full single-threaded concurrency
 - Pools persistent keep-alive connections
 - Transparently follows redirects
 - Decodes gzipped entity bodies
 - Exposes headers and message data
 - Streams entity bodies for memory management with large transfers
 - Supports all standard and custom HTTP method verbs
 - Simplifies HTTP form submissions
 - Implements secure-by-default TLS (`https://`)
 - Supports cookies and sessions
 - Functions seamlessly behind HTTP proxies

## Project Goals

 - Model all code as closely as possible to the relevant HTTP protocol RFCs
 - Implement an HTTP/1.1 client built on socket streams with no `libcurl` dependency

## Installation

This package can be installed as a [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) dependency.
